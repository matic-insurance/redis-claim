Prevent conflicts of several apps using same Redis database or namespace. 
Allows to check if db is already taken and claim ownership of the db.

Common use case for the gem is microservices that share single physical redis instance. 
In such case it is common problem to make an error in redis url, or namespace.   

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'redis-claim'
```

## Usage

On the start of your application execute following code. 
Exception will be raised in case of configuration or claim error 

```ruby
Redis::Claim.verify do |config|
  # Your redis instance you want to claim
  config.redis = REDIS      
  # Application name to detect any other service that claimed db  
  config.app_name = 'my cool application'
end
```

For rails you can add this code to custom initializer `redis_claim.rb` in `app/config/initializers`

## Behaviour

Redis Claim has following execution steps

1. Executed only once on start of the application. 
1. Checks connection to redis by calling `ping` command
1. Sets lock key if it does not exist with `setnx` command
1. Reads lock key if it exists and compares to `app_name`
1. Checks if existing lock key is the same as `app_name`

**IMPORTANT** Redis claim will not detect db conflict if another application/service is not using it 

## Development

1. [Install Redis](https://redis.io//download)
1. Run `bin/setup` to install dependencies
1. Run tests `rspec`
1. Add new test
1. Add new code
1. Go to step 3
